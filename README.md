# Text Editor

- I recommend Visual Studio Code. It has support for a lot of plugins, it's relatively easy to use, and it's commonly used in the industry.
- Some Visual Studio Code plugins I recommend:
  - HTML CSS Support
- Use vim if you want to make your life unnecessarily difficult

# Host on GitHub Pages

- Make an account on https://github.com

## Create a repository
- Click the plus sign in the top right corner
- Click "New repository"
- Name your repository. Add a description if you want. Keep the repository public.
- Click "Create repository" at the bottom

## Add your files
- Find your files in your file explorer on your computer
- Select them all and drag and drop them into the browser where you have your GitHub tab open.
- All the files will be added

## Publish
- Click on the Settings tab
- Click on the Pages tab
- Under "Source", click on the dropdown and select the default branch, which is either master or main.
- Click save
- A url will popup that looks like: https://github.com/[your username]/[your repository name]/settings/pages
- It may take a few minutes for your website to appear here
